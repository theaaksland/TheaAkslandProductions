            <h4>Christmas With Snow</h4>
            <p>Christmas with snow came from my longing for home during the winter time in New Orleans. Growing up in Colorado, snowfall was a key part in the holiday season and I spent this christmas alone and in the city of New Orleans. Longing for the Christmas spirit, I wrote this song to capture a memory.</p>

            <H4>Photographs</H4>
            <p>Dedicated to Melanie and David Aksland, my parents. Growing up, my parents have been my inspiration and example of love. They continually retell old stories about their relationship and the moments they savor even forty years down the road. I wanted to write them something special and write about true love.</p>

            <H4>Face My Truth</H4>
            <p>Good old high school heartbreak. Face my truth is about the toxic feelings of love, when you know it’s bad for you but that only makes you want it more. Acknowledge your denial and fall deeper in love with the untouchable.</p>
